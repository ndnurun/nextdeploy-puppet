# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore .swp
*.swp

# Ignore temporary folder
/tmp/*
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore nohup file
nohup.out

# Ignore bundler config.
.bundle

#rubymine folder
.idea

# Ignore varnish projects override folder
/pm/templates/varnish/projects/*
!/pm/templates/varnish/projects/.gitkeep

# Ignore iptable projects files
/pm/files/fw/projects/*
!/pm/files/fw/projects/.gitkeep
